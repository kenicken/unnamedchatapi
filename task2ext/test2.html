<h1>Breakaway</h1>
<h2>Kelly Clarkson</h2>
<h4>
Grew up in a small town <br>
And when the rain would fall down <br>
I'd just stare out my window <br>
Dreaming of what could be <br>
And if I'd end up happy <br>
I would pray <br> <br>

Trying hard to reach out <br>
But when I tried to speak out <br>
Felt like no one could hear me <br>
Wanted to belong here <br>
But something felt so wrong here <br>
So I'd pray <br>
I could break away <br> <br>

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly. <br>
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky. <br>
Make a wish, take a chance, <br>
Make a change, and break away. <br>
Out of the darkness and into the sun. <br>
But I won't forget all the ones that I love. <br>
I'll take a risk, take a chance, <br>
Make a change, and break away <br> <br>

Wanna feel the warm breeze <br>
Sleep under a palm tree <br>
Feel the rush of the ocean <br>
Get onboard a fast train <br>
Travel on a jetplane <br>
Far away <br>
And break away <br> <br>

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly. <br>
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky. <br>
Make a wish, take a chance, <br>
Make a change, and break away. <br>
Out of the darkness and into the sun. <br>
But I won't forget all the ones that I love. <br>
I'll take a risk, take a chance, <br>
Make a change, and break away <br> <br>

Buildings with a hundred floors <br>
Swinging with revolving doors <br>
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but <br>
Gotta keep movin on movin on <br>
Fly away <br>
Break away <br> <br>

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly. <br>
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye <br>
Take a risk, take a chance, <br>
Make a change, and break away. <br>
Out of the darkness and into the sun. <br>
But I won't forget the place I come from <br>
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, <br>
Make a change, and break away <br>
Breakaway <br>
Break away <br>
